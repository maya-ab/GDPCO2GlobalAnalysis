# Research Questions

My research questions focus on CO2 emissions and GDP. In my research I utilized python, pandas, numpy, and seaborn. By manipulating certain datasets and creating visualizations, I answered the following questions:

Over the years, how does the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions compare for the 15 richest Countries vs the 15 poorest countries? What about during financial crises periods?

How does the average CO2 emissions per capita of high GDP countries compare to low GDP countries, and the rest of the world? Has this changed over the years?
